# ec2s-from-cf

EC2s made to various specifications, with Cloudformation. Don't bother wasting your time creating these at work - just copy them from here instead, and make any minor adaptations as may be required.

Here's how to order:

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file ./ec2.3.yaml --stack-name ec2v3
